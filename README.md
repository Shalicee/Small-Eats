DO NOT CODE ON MASTER BRANCH

*************************

Install the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension in VSCode<br />
Sign into github on VS Code (above the settings wheel)<br />
Go to the source control option on VS Code (3rd tab on the left list)<br />
Click the hyperlink to install git with all recommended settings<br />
Restart VS Code and go back to source control and select clone repository.<br />
Enter this url https://github.com/McKenna242/SmallEats_Mern into the bar in the top middle of VScode<br />
Download the config.zip file pinned in the discord for term project<br />
Unzip the file and place it in the location -> mern-smalleats-app->backend file <br />
Now you should have all the files from git downloaded.<br />
Open them in VSCode and then head to chrome<br />
Google or go to nodejs.org and install node.js for your computer<br />
Check automatically install all necessary tools during installation <br />
Once itâ€™s installed you need to add node js to your path. This article details how to accomplish that:<br />
https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/blogs/npm-is-not-recognized-from-visual-studio<br />
Once node js is added to path open and close vs code and navigate back to the project folder.<br />
Open mern-smalleats-app (double check that it's mern-smalleats-app) in the integrated terminal and type the command <br />
npm install<br />
then<br />
npm run install-all<br />
This will take a little but it will install all the required local files to run the website. <br />
Then install global nodemon<br />
npm i -g nodemon<br />
Once the install is finished type<br />
npm run dev<br />
This should automatically open a web browser to localhost:3000 and you should be able to see the website. <br />


npm run dev will start the server whenever you need to access it moving forward<br />

Rest.model.js in backend in the model the holds the database structure for the backend.
Server.js hosts the server and uses rest.model.js to send the database info back, these have to changed together. 

App.js in the src file is the frontend. It imports other frontend items from the components file where new additions should be stored and then imported into app.js for display.
